# CHECKLIST

# Iteams required to complete the project
- need to add classes, functions and map
- need to write prompts and make sure the user input works 
- need to write various paths the user could choose
- the interaction with the guard needs to be fixed
- the first function needs to be re written
- the ending needs to be fixed for the 'supplies' path

# Possible future tasks to expand the program
- add the option to involve other prisoners into escape
- add a post escape section. (planning where one will go to after the escape) 
more to the story than just getting out the prison. How will one still off the grid and not get caught again?
- involve more authorities into the plot (Warden calls you in for meetings, you get to interact with the guards and the workers)
- the user could strenghten their in game abilities and traits (have certain traits that will help them escape)
